    <h3>CSS Overflow-x Property</h3>
    <p>We can use the overflow-x and overflow-y properties to control the overflow horizontally and vertically. In this example, I have set overflow-x to scroll so I can scroll from left to right to view the image. But I set the overflow-y to hidden so I can't scroll up and down.</p>
