                    A self-taught web developer, passionate about various technologies. Currently working in a high impact environment with frequent deployments, helping development teams build great products. I like sharing what I know, therefore I have been teaching students in my free time. I have been trying to make small impacts with my skills for which, to reach a larger audience. What's good? if there is no fun in life. So, when I am not coding or writing about my codes, I love binge watching a web series or go out on long drives and meet new people.
